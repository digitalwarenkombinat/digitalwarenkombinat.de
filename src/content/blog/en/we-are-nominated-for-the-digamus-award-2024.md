Wow, <a href='/projects/glamorous-europe/'>**GLAMorous Europe**</a> is on the shortlist for the DigAMus Award 2024 and has been nominated in the Apps and Games category. In addition to the jury prize, there is also an audience award. This means you can actively support us by going to the DigAMus Award's website and voting for us.

To do this, go to the [project page of GLAMorous Europe](https://digamus-award.de/project/glamorous-europe/) on the DigAMus Awards website and click on the star. With every star clicked, we receive one public vote - and the project with the most votes wins.

Here you can find the entire [DigAMus Award shortlist](https://digamus-award.de/shortlist/), which collects many other great, educational and aesthetic apps and web applications from museums. Also take a look at the [longlist](https://digamus-award.de/award-2024/longlist/), there's even more to discover there.

**_And what exactly is the DigAMus Award?_**

Every year, the DigAMus Award recognizes the best digital projects from museums. Even though we are not a classic internally developed museum project, our <a href='/projects/glamorous-europe/'>**GLAMorous Europe**</a> project works with data from museum collections.

**_Update from May 22, 2024_**

Unfortunately, we did not win an audience award with <a href='/projects/glamorous-europe/'>**GLAMorous Europe**</a>. Thank you for your active support in the voting! Just being on the shortlist is a huge success for our visibility.
