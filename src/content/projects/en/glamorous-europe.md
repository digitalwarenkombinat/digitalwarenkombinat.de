**GLAMorous Europe â€“ Dating the GLAMs of your neighbours**

The open-source web application **GLAMorous Europe** brings culture enthusiasts together with collection objects from European museums, libraries, galleries and archives.

Starting as a random selection of digitized paintings, prints, sculptures and photographs, users' decisions create an increasingly personalized collection that can be explored and transformed into their own works of art.

**_Selection_**

First, users are shown various works of art from different European collections. Behind each of the displayed artworks is a Wikidata dataset that is integrated via API.

If the user likes the displayed image, it can be collected by swiping to the right - if they don't like it, it is discarded by swiping to the left. A new image is then displayed.

**_Collection_**

Based on these decisions, a personalized, digital collection is created according to the user's interests, which can be browsed further. The integration of the IIIF viewer _Clover_ also enables a _deep zoom_ into the high-resolution scanned artworks and individual image elements can be lassoed or image sections can be created for further use on the canvas.

**_Canvas_**

Objects, image sections and prefabricated favorite pieces can then be dragged and dropped together to create a new work of art. The contrast, brightness and position of the elements can be adjusted. At the end, the resulting artwork can be shared digitally or analog.

**GLAMorous Europe** is a prototype that is still undergoing further development. For example, we are planning to integrate Wikipedia information on the individual art objects, as well as additional collection and editing options.

**GLAMorous Europe** also offers the option of optimizing and adapting the application for an individual cultural institution, exhibition, etc. The application can therefore also be used as a media tool. The application can therefore also be used as a media station in an exhibition. Please contact us for alternative uses.

**GLAMorous Europe** was funded as part of the 14th funding round of the Prototype Fund from September 2023 to February 2024. The Prototype Fund is a funding program of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), which is managed and evaluated by the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany.
