**Living Democracy** accompanies three children from the working class towards the end of the 1920s on their way to a children's republic - a socialist tent camp.

Realized as a scrollytelling website, with **Living Democracy** we accompany Anna, Karl and Gerda on their journey to a tent camp run by the social democratic organization _Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft der Kinderfreunde_. In this so-called children's republic, they experience many exciting things and learn about democracy through their own actions.

The story of the three children is told through many small animated films, mini-games and soundscapes that bring to life everyday life in a children's republic as a place of democratic education for children and young people in the Weimar Republic.

**Living Democracy** was developed as part of the _Coding da Vinci Westfalen-Ruhrgebiet 2019_ cultural hackathon. The project is based on photos and material from the Archiv der Arbeiterjugendbewegung (Archive of the Workers' Youth Movement) in Oer-Erkenschwick. In 2020, we supplemented and expanded the project for the purposes of the archive as part of a Coding da Vinci grant.
